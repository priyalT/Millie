Millie is a virtual pet application that I have created for a semester-end python project. It's part of the coursework. 
The keys for this pseudo-game are:
1. Press the 'Up' key to petting Millie, and watch her wag her tail very happily!
2. Press the Spacebar key to make Millie go to sleep, and watch her as she snores cutely.
3. Press the 'C' key to feed Millie some chicken, and she'll nom her way through!
